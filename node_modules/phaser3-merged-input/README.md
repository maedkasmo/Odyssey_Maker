# Merged input plugin for Phaser 3
A Phaser 3 plugin to map input from keyboard, gamepad & mouse to player actions.

The merged input plugin listens to input from keyboard, connected gamepads and the mouse pointer, updating ‘player’ objects that you may interrogate instead of writing separate input handlers in your game.
Each player object contains direction and button actions. These are updated by the corresponding gamepad input, as well as any keys that you assign to the action.

## Benefits 
. Single place to handle all your input.  
. Keyboard, Gamepad & Mouse input is amalgamated.  
. Handle input for multiple player objects to easily create multiplayer games.  
. Assign and reassign keys to actions for each player, allowing for ‘redefine keys’ function.  
. Assign multiple keys to a single action.  
. Interrogate current state of all buttons.  
. Global events emitted on button down/up.  
. Check for gamepad button presses (i.e. ‘justDown()’ functionality for gamepads)  
. Check the last device type used for interaction.  

## Setup
Set up a player object for each player in your game with `addPlayer()`.
Then assign keys to each action with the `defineKey()` function, e.g.
```javascript
var player1 = mergedInput.addPlayer(0);
mergedInput.defineKey(0, 'UP', 'W')
    .defineKey(0, 'DOWN', 'S')
    .defineKey(0, 'LEFT', 'A')
    .defineKey(0, 'RIGHT', 'D')
    .defineKey(0, 'B0', 'U')
    .defineKey(0, 'B1', 'I')
    .defineKey(0, 'B2', 'O')
    .defineKey(0, 'B3', 'P')

var player2 = mergedInput.addPlayer(1);
mergedInput.defineKey(1, 'UP', 'UP')
    .defineKey(1, 'DOWN', 'DOWN')
    .defineKey(1, 'LEFT', 'LEFT')
    .defineKey(1, 'RIGHT', 'RIGHT')
    .defineKey(1, 'B0', 'NUMPAD_0')
    .defineKey(1, 'B1', 'NUMPAD_1')
    .defineKey(1, 'B2', 'NUMPAD_2')
    .defineKey(1, 'B3', 'NUMPAD_3')
```

Then, interrogate your player objects to check for the state of the _action_, rather than the key, e.g.
```javascript
    if(player1.direction.DOWN) {
        // Move your player down
    }

    if(player2.buttons.B0 > 0) {
        // Player two is pressing the first button
    }
```

## Demo / Dev
A demo scene is included in the repository.  
![](src/demo/merged-input-demo.gif)  
Install with `npm install`, then use `npm run dev` to spin up a development server and run the demo scene.


## Build plugin
Build the plugin including minified version. Targets the dist folder.
`npm run build`

## Changelog
v1.1.0 - 2020-04-19
Plugin now handles secondary directional movement from the second stick on a gamepad.
Bearings and degrees have been added to direction objects.

v1.2.0 - 2020-04-27
You are now able to pass a player's X/Y position to a player object, whereupon the position of the mouse in relation to that player will be used to determine mouse bearings and degrees

v1.2.1 - 2020-04-27
Actually added the build files.

v1.2.2 - 2020-05-03 
Added secondary direction key detection, so that secondary directions may be instigated through a keypress as well as the right stick of a gamepad.
Added timestamps to interactions making it possible to tell which was last used, e.g. keyboard vs mouse.

v1.2.3 - 2020-05-08
Added extra handling for 'null' gamepads.

v1.2.4 - 2020-05-08
And again, remembering to include the built files would be a bonus.
