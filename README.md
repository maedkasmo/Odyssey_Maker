# 2D Mario Odyssey Engine

A proof of concept 2D demake of the 2017 Nintendo Switch game Super Mario Odyssey.

I created it using Phaser 3 and its tilemap engine. I was initially considering on switching physics engines due to several roadblocks, but I figured I should get some feedback first before making a decision.
